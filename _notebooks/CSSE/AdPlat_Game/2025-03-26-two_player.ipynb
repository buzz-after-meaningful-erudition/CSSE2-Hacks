    "Let's summarize the key aspects of implementing a two-player system in the game:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Player Class Separation**:\n",
    "   - Create separate player classes (PlayerOne and PlayerTwo)\n",
    "   - Each player handles its own keyboard events\n",
    "   - Configure different key mappings for each player\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Level Configuration**:\n",
    "   - Define data objects for each player with appropriate properties\n",
    "   - Set different starting positions on the screen\n",
    "   - Include both player classes in the level's `classes` array\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visual Differentiation**:\n",
    "   - Give each player a different appearance (blue vs red squares)\n",
    "   - Position players on different sides of the screen\n",
    "   - Ensure each player's canvas has a unique ID\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Collision Handling**:\n",
    "   - Implement a collision detection system that works between different player objects\n",
    "   - Calculate the minimum overlap to determine the most natural collision response\n",
    "   - Reposition objects to prevent clipping and ensure fair physics\n",
    "   - Use velocity adjustment to stop movement in collision directions\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Event Handling Separation**:\n",
    "   - Each player listens to global keyboard events\n",
    "   - Each player only responds to its specific key codes\n",
    "   - Key binding happens in each player's constructor\n",

    "## Practical Implementation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to implement a two-player system in your own game, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create separate player classes** or use a single class with different configurations:\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   // Option 1: Separate classes\n",
    "   class PlayerOne extends GameObject { ... }\n",
    "   class PlayerTwo extends GameObject { ... }\n",
    "   \n",
    "   // Option 2: Single class with configuration\n",
    "   class Player extends GameObject {\n",
    "     constructor(data) {\n",
    "       // Use data to configure controls, appearance, etc.\n",
    "     }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Configure different controls** for each player:\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   // Player One uses WASD\n",
    "   const player1Controls = {up: 87, left: 65, down: 83, right: 68};\n",
    "   \n",
    "   // Player Two uses IJKL\n",
    "   const player2Controls = {up: 73, left: 74, down: 75, right: 76};\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initialize both players** in your game level:\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   this.player1 = new PlayerOne(player1Data, gameEnv);\n",
    "   this.player2 = new PlayerTwo(player2Data, gameEnv);\n",
    "   this.gameObjects.push(this.player1, this.player2);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Implement collision detection** that works between players:\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   // In your update loop\n",
    "   checkCollisions() {\n",
    "     // Check if player 1 and player 2 are colliding\n",
    "     const isColliding = this.checkObjectsCollision(this.player1, this.player2);\n",
    "     if (isColliding) {\n",
    "       this.resolveCollision(this.player1, this.player2);\n",
    "     }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Ensure fair physics** by handling collisions symmetrically:\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   resolveCollision(obj1, obj2) {\n",
    "     // Calculate overlap\n",
    "     // Move both objects back based on the overlap\n",
    "     // Adjust velocities accordingly\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing a two-player system in a JavaScript game involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creating separate player classes or configurations\n",
    "2. Mapping different control schemes for each player\n",
    "3. Handling player-to-player collisions fairly\n",
    "4. Updating and rendering each player independently\n",
    "5. Managing the game state to accommodate multiple players\n",
    "\n",
    "The GameLevelSquares implementation demonstrates these principles with two simple colored squares controlled by different key sets. This pattern can be extended to more complex games with sprite animations, different player abilities, and more sophisticated physics.\n",

    "- Adding player scores or health systems\n",
    "- Implementing player vs. player combat mechanics\n",
    "- Creating cooperative gameplay elements\n",
    "- Adding more visual polish to differentiate players"

    "## Hacks\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to do this first hack.\n",
    "1. Implement the two player system into your own games. one player should use WASD and the other can either use IJKL or arrow keys (up, down, left, right).\n",
    "\n",
    "### CHOOSE ONE:\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add collectible items that can be picked up by either player\n",
    "3. Create a simple \"push\" mechanic where players can push each other when colliding, or make it so that collisions stop both players entirely. If you want to make an extension of this, make one player stronger or faster than the other so they can push the other player around!"
